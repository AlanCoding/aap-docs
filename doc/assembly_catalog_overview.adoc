= Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Management - Catalog Overview

Red Hat's Hybrid Cloud Management - Catalog enables self-service provisioning across hybrid cloud infrastructure. Allows administrators to govern content to users, Catalog also provides multi-level approval using Middleware Decision Manager.

Catalog integrates with existing _platforms_, grouping content and access by _portfolios_, each containing _products_ that users can order.

.How it works

. *Integration:* Catalog connects to a platform and harvests content metadata, discovering available product offerings. 
. *Grouping:* Portfolios allow administrators to group platform content. This enables application of access control permissions and grouping of hybrid items.
. *Order:* Users can order products from portfolios they have access to, providing one access point to many platforms.
