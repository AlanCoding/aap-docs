= Deploying a high availability automation hub

This guide provides an overview of the requirements and procedures for a high availability deployment of your {HubName}.

A high availability (HA) configuration prepares your system for damage mitigation, where a failure in a primary cluster prompts a standby cluster to take over, resulting in no downtime for the customer. HA provides a reliable and scalable solution that minimizes downtime for your Ansible automation environment. In the case of {HubName}, you can set up high availability by configuring your {HubName} deployment to do so using the {PlatformName} (AAP) installer.

Please note that this guide covers deployment of a HA {HubName} application stack only. Other HA components, such as database and file system HA, or setting up DNS load balancing, are out of scope for this guide.
