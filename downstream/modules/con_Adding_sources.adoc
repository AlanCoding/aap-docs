== Adding sources

Sources are the platforms [product-title] connects to in order to collect inventory information used to organize and present products available to users. To use [product-title_short], you need to connect the application to at least one source.

=== Adding an Ansible Tower source

Connect an Ansible Tower instance to [product-title] to create products from its inventory of playbooks and workflows your users can view and order from.

After connecting your Ansible Tower instance, navigate back to [product-title_short] to review templates available on that platform, and add those products to your portfolios.
