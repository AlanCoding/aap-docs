= Note for `pip`-based requirements

Python requirements files are combined into a single file using the `requirements-parser` library in order to support complex syntax. Entries from separate collections that give the same package name will be combined into the same entry, with the constraints combined.

See https://github.com/ansible/awx-ee/blob/devel/_build/requirements_combined.txt[this link] for an example of a combined Python requirements file.

There are several package names which are specifically ignored by `ansible-builder`; if a collection lists these, they will not be included in the combined file. These include test packages and packages that provide Ansible itself.

The full list can be found in `EXCLUDE_REQUIREMENTS` in the https://github.com/ansible/ansible-builder/blob/devel/ansible_builder/requirements.py[ansible_builder.requirements.py] module.
