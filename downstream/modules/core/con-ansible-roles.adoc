= About Ansible Roles

[role="_abstract"]

In Ansible, a "role" is a way of bundling automation content and making it reusable. Instead of creating huge playbooks with hundreds of plays, you can use roles to break the tasks apart into smaller, more discrete units of work.

You can find roles for provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do every day on Ansible Galaxy. Filter your search by *Type* and select *Role*. Once you find a role that you're interested in, you can download it by using the `ansible-galaxy` command that comes bundled with Ansible:

-----
$ ansible-galaxy install username.rolename
-----
