= {Navigator} modes

{Navigator} operates in two modes:

[role="_abstract"]

stdout mode:: Accepts most of the existing Ansible commands and extensions at the command line.
text-based user interface mode:: Provides an interactive, text-based interface to the Ansible commands for an enhanced set of capabilities that allow you to evaluate content, run playbooks, and troubleshoot playbooks after they run using artifact files.

== stdout mode

If you use the `-m stdout` subcommand, {Navigator} uses the familiar Ansible commands, such as `ansible-playbook` within {ExecEnvName}, or on your local development environment. This mode allows you to continue using commands you are familiar with for quick tasks.

== Text-based user interface mode

The text-based user interface mode provides enhanced interaction with {ExecEnvName}, collections, playbooks, and inventory. This mode is compatible with integrated development environments (IDE), such as Visual Studio Code.
