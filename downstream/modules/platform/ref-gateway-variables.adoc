This account will have administrative access to all components as well, such as automation controller.

Default = `admin`
| *`admin_password`* | The password for the administration user account.

This can be used to login to the platform UI, and also be used for direct access to any components, such as automation controller.

Set to a blank string to leave the administrative account with an unusable password, which can still for allow social auth.

Passwords must be enclosed in quotes when they are provided in plain text in the inventory file.
| *`admin_email`* | The email associated with the administration user account.

Default = `admin@example.com`
| *`automationgateway_pg_host`* | The hostname of the Postgres database used by platform gateway, which can be an externally managed database.

| *`automationgateway_pg_password`* | The password for the Postgres database used by platform gateway.

Use of special characters for `automationgateway_pg_password` is limited. The `!`, `#`, `0` and `@` characters are supported. Use of other special characters can cause the setup to fail.

| *`automationgateway_pg_sslmode`* | Choose one of the two available modes: `prefer` and `verify-full`.

Set to `verify-full` for client-side enforced SSL.

Default = `prefer`.

| *`automationgateway_main_url`* | The main platform gateway URL that clients will connect to (e.g. `https://<gateway-node>`).

If not specified, the first node in the `[automationgateway]` group will be used when needed.
