= Network Storage Installation Requirements

If you intend to install a HA {HubName} using a network storage on the {HubName} nodes itself, you must first install and use _firewalld_ to open the necessary ports as required by your shared storage system before running the {PlatformNameShort} installer.

Install and configure _firewalld_ by executing the following commands:

. Install the _firewalld_ daemon:
+
-----
$ dnf install firewalld
-----
+
. Add your network storage under <service> using the following command:
+
-----
$ firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=<service>
-----
[NOTE]
For a list of supported services, run `$ firewall-cmd --get-services`
+
. Reload to apply the configuration:
+
-----
$ firewall-cmd --reload
-----
+
