= About remote repositories

You can configure your local Automation Hub to sync with Red Hat Certified Collections hosted in your organization repository on cloud.redhat.com and to your choice of collections in Ansible Galaxy by configuring remote repositories.

Each remote repository located in menu[Repo Management > Remote] provides information for both *community* and *rh-certified* about when the repo was *last updated* and when content was *last synced*. You can add new content to Automation Hub at any time using the *Edit* and *Sync* features included on the *Repo Management* -> *Remote* page.
