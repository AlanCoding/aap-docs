= Managing the publication process of internal collections in Automation Hub

You can use Automation Hub to manage and publish content collections developed within your organization and intended for internal distribution and use. Collections are uploaded and grouped into namespaces, and require administrative approval to appear in the *Published* content repository. Once published, your users can access and download it for use.

Additionally, you can reject submitted collections that do not meet organizational certification criteria.
